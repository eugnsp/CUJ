### April – Volume 10, Number 4

* John W. M. Stevens. [*Lexical Analysis Using Search Tries*](10.04/jstevens/jstevens.md)\
*This special type of tree is a good fit for language translation applications.*

### December – Volume 10, Number 12

* Tim Prince. [*Tuning Up Math Functions*](10.12/prince/prince.md)\
*Dr. Prince shows that math functions can always be made better.*

## 1993

### February – Volume 11, Number 2

* David W. Schwartz. [*An Efficient Method for Optimizing Binary Trees*](11.02/schwartz/schwartz.md)\
*Seems you can always improve how you handle binary trees – David Schwartz shows another useful technique.*

## 1994

### October – Volume 12, Number 10

* Christopher Skelly. [*Powerful Pointers to Member Functions*](12.10/skelly/skelly.md)\
*So you thought you finally understood pointers in C. Now meet pointers to members in C++.*

## 1995

### March 1995 – Volume 13, Number 3

* Bob Stout. [*“Olympic” Filtering for Noisy Data*](13.03/stout/stout.md)\
*Sometimes the simplest techniques yield surprisingly good results. When it comes to filtering input data on a small embedded system, simplicity is a major virtue.*

* Blase B. Cindric. [*When the “Best” Algorithm Isn’t*](13.03/cindric/cindric.md)\
*Knowledge is power, particularly when choosing an algorithm. The more you know about your data, the better you can tailor how you manipulate it for better performance.*

### April 1995 – Volume 13, Number 4

* Dan Saks. [*Stepping Up to C++: Mutable Class Members*](13.04/saks/saks.md)

### July 1995 – Volume 13, Number 7

* P. J. Plauger. [*Standard C/C++: The Header `<string>`*](13.07/plauger/plauger.md)

## 1996

### January 1996 – Volume 14, Number 1

* Dan Saks. [*The Column that Needs a Name: Understanding C++ Declarators*](14.01/saks/saks.md)

### October 1996 – Volume 14, Number 10

* Chuck Allison. [*C++: The Making of a Standard*](14.10/allison/allison.md)\

* Marc Marini. [*A Class Hierarchy for Random Number Generation*](14.10/marini/marini.md)\
*Class derivation makes sense as a way of inheriting mathematical properties, not just common data.*

## 1997

### March 1997 – Volume 15, Number 3

* Rodney B. Doe, P.E. [*How to Leak Memory in C++*](15.03/doe/doe.md)\
*Warning: These are untrained professionals at work here. Do not try this at home.*

### May 1997 – Volume 15, Number 5

* P. J. Plauger. [*Standard C/C++: Implementing Associative Containers*](15.05/plauger/plauger.md)\
*At the heart of every STL set or map lies a balanced binary tree, or at least a tree that’s almost balanced.*

---

## 1998

### January – Volume 16, Number 1

* Pete Becker. [*Questions & Answers: The Complex Evolution of `<string>`*](16.01/becker/becker.md)\
*Pete describes how class string got that way, and how to avoid a few pitfalls in writing C expressions.*

### November – Volume 16, Number 11

* P. J. Plauger. [*Standard C/C++: Hash Tables*](16.11/plauger/plauger.md)\
*Hash tables didn't make it into the C++ Standard, but they're too popular to ignore.*

---

## 1999

### January – Volume 17, Number 1

* Radoslav Getov. [*Persistent Vector Iterators*](17.01/getov/getov.md)\
*Template class vector has some annoying properties. But you can hide them, and still make use of the good stuff, by deriving another template class from vector.*

### August – Volume 17, Number 8

* P. J. Plauger. [*Standard C/C++: A Better List*](17.08/plauger/plauger.md)\
*How hard can it be to maintain a linked list? You'd be surprised. Our Senior Editor certainly was.*

---

## 2000

### February – Volume 18, Number 2

* P. J. Plauger. [*Standard C/C++: A Singly Linked List*](18.02/plauger/plauger.md)\
*Every design involves tradeoffs. The trick is to tradeoff using much the same principles as for related designs.*

### October – Volume 18, Number 10

* Klaus Kreft and Angelika Langer. [*Effective Standard C++ Library: Are `set` Iterators Mutable or Immutable?*](18.10/kreft/kreft.md)\
*The C++ Standard mandates that containers such as `std::set` provide both mutable and immutable iterators. Unfortunately, mutable iterators turn out to be dangerous when used with sets.*
